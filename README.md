  <h1>Jenkins</h1>
  <p><i>Trying out Jenkins Blue Ocean to test APIs</i></p>
</div>

### Why?

I have only worked with Gitlab CI so far, so I must learn another tool. Maybe I should try Github Actions as well.

### TODOs:

* Include Blue Ocean UI plugin
* Write a simple express API
* Unit test with Jest
* Test with Postman's Newman
* Write a Jenkins Pipeline
